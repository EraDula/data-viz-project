				<h3>Visualisation Description:</h3>
				<h6> Research question 3</h6>
				Analyze what the most effective factors for
				driving conversions in online ad campaigns are, in particular for a big
				platform like Facebook. How do they differ, which have a stronger impact?
				<br></br>
				<h6>Data background</h6>
				The graph represents a visualisation of data collected from Facebook AD
				campaigns, and how different factors effect the number of approved
				conversions of ADs, that is, the number of people who bought the product
				after seeing the AD.
				<br>
				The different factors are as follows:
				<ul>
					<li>Clicks: The number of times the AD was clicked on</li>
					<li>Spent: Amount paid by company xyz to Facebook, to show that AD.</li>
					<li>Total Conversions: Total number of people who enquired about the
						product after seeing the AD.</li>
					<li>Impressions: The number of times the AD was shown. The legend on the
						graph shows what size maps to how many impressions.</li>
				</ul>
				The visualisation above is a bubble plot, essentially a scatter plot with an
				additional dimension: the value of an additional numeric variable is
				represented through the size of the dots, in this graph I have chosen the
				number of Impressions to be reflected.
				<br></br>
			<h6>How to interact</h6>
			Here is a list of interactions the graph provides:
			<ul>
				<li>Hover over the bubbles on the plot to display a popup of information
					showing the value of the 3 dimensions for that point.</li>
				<li>Click on the dropdown and change the X variable you want to display on
					the graph - where the scale will adapt accordingly!</li>
				<li>Toggle the reggresion line switch to display the least squares
					regression line of the currently displayed scatter plot.</li>
				<li>Hover over the regression line to display the equation of the line and
					the correlation coefficient 'R' which indicates the strength of the
					correlation.</li>
			</ul>
			Note: The regression line will update even when changing the factor (X
			variable) while the regression toggle is on. How cool?!

			<h3>Data-processing:</h3>
			<h6>Data cleaning</h6>
			The data set provides data that can be used as it is without any cleaning required. 
			Initially, I wanted to remove the adverts that had no money spent on them as this 
			would be considered no advert and would skew the graph which shows factors that effect
			adverts and products being used themselves. However I decided against this because, 
			after filtering these, I found that 71 ADs which were "no budget" had a greater than
			0 number of approved conversions. This would actually be useful because it shows that
			some companies don't need to spend on advertisment in order to sell a product. This is 
			what would weaken the strengthen of the correlation between the money spent on adverts 
			and the conversions, which can be seen in the graph by toggling the regression line.
			<br></br>
			<h6>Data transformation</h6>
			The data types of the values from the data set were correctly set. On the other hand 
			when processing the data to calculate the line of regression and the correlation coefficient, 
			values needed to be casted back into floating point or integer when passed through functions 
			as objects (as the data would be converted into strings).
			<br></br>
			<h6>Data analysis</h6>
			The transformed data is analyzed to identify patterns, trends, and insights. You can see 
			from the visualisation a clear correlation that is strong amongst total and approved conversions of ADs.
			<br></br>
			<h6>Decision making</h6>
			The visualisations of data help to make decisions about future Facebook ad campaigns. For example, 
			if the analysis shows that increasing the amount spent on ads leads to a higher number of approved 
			conversions, a decision may be made to increase the ad spending in future campaigns.

			<h3>Future improvements:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Including more options to filter the visualisation on which will change the y axis too. 
					This will help see trends between data you might not even expect, even though correlation 
					doesn't imply causation it would be useful insight to Facebook for their AD campaigns.</li>
				<li>Finding and combining datasets which show more explicit information on the type of ADs</li>
			</ul>
