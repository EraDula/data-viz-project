# Facebook AD Campaigns Visualisation ðŸ“ˆ

This is a web application which utilises data visualisation techniques to implement a bubble plot that provides insights on the factors that effect how impactful Facebook advertisements are and how often it is the case that the products advertised are actually bought. The visualisation has been implemented using [D3](https://d3js.org/).

This aims to help answer the following research question: Analyze what the most effective factors for driving conversions in online ad campaigns are, in particular for a big platform like Facebook. How do they differ, which have a stronger impact?

Note: *This was completed as part of a project for the module 7CCSMSDV - Simulation & Data Visualisation.*
